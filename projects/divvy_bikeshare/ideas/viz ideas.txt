split tables according to member type
do comparision 
	- ride duration (avg men median)								- bar graph for avg ride time
	- ridable type comparision 								- bar graph with multi variable
	- type of membership to start location (do i see a cycle near my home)		- 
	- using lat long ascending order distance from city core to vizualize trend line 	-
	- end station with some corellation to location like universities 			-
	

idea 1. 

station_start_membership dataset

Adier planetarium has more casual members than annual members 
a reward point based system which gives more rewards (1X, 2X, 3X )when starting ride from this planetarium to members. thereby encouraging more casual members to have an incetive to become a member. 
and also the marketing ads are to be placed in and around places with more casual ride starting points.
