**Reflection**
First, consider your data conversation and how it went. Here are some questions to help you get started:

    Was there anything challenging about getting the conversation started?

    Were there questions you didn’t get to ask?

    Did you manage your time effectively?

    Did you take notes? Are they as detailed as you need them to be?

    Are you missing any information? Is there anything that you still find unclear or vague?

    If you could do the conversation over again, is there anything you would change?

Next, turn your attention to your notes and reflect on what you know about the data itself:

    What are the sources of data available for the project?

    Which data sources were qualitative and which were quantitative? Explain your answer.

    What decisions could you make when considering each data source separately? Could you make different decisions about the data if you combined it? If so, give an example.

    Is there any kind of data that isn’t available, but you would like to find? If so, what is it, and why would you like to know more about it?

## Qualitative vs Quantitative Data

| Qualitative data tools         | Quantitative data tools |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Focus groups                   | Structured interviews   |
| Social media text interactions | Surveys                 |
| In-person interviews           | Polls                   |

## Dashboard
> A dashboard is a single point of access for managing a business's information. It allows analysts to pull key information from data in a quick review by visualizing the data in a way that makes findings easy to understand. 
### Types of dashboards
> Strategic: focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics
> - These dashboards provide information over the longest time frame—from a single financial quarter to years. 
> - They typically contain information that is useful for enterprise-wide decision-making. 
<img src="/Data_Analysis/img/strategic_dashboard.png" width="600">

> Operational: short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals
> - these dashboards contain information on a time scale of days, weeks, or months, they can provide performance insight almost in real-time. 
> - This allows businesses to track and maintain their immediate operational processes in light of their strategic goals.
<img src="/Data_Analysis/img/operational_dashboard.png" width="600">

> Analytical: consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets
> - Analytic dashboards contain a vast amount of data used by data analysts. These dashboards contain the details involved in the usage, analysis, and predictions made by data scientists. 
> -  Analytic dashboards are usually created and maintained by data science teams and rarely shared with upper management as they can be very difficult to understand.
<img src="/Data_Analysis/img/analytical_dashboard.png" width="600">

## Big and Small Data
> Small Data
> - Describes a data set made up of specific metrics over a short, well-defined time period.
> - Usually organized and analyzed in spreadsheets.
> - Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses.
> - Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent .
> - Usually already a manageable size for analysis.

> Big Data
> - Describes large, less-specific data sets that cover a long time period.
> - Usually kept in a database and queried.
> - Likely to be used by large organizations.
> - Takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent.
> - Usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making.

> Challenges with Big data:
> - A lot of organizations deal with data overload and way too much unimportant or irrelevant information. 
> - Important data can be hidden deep down with all of the non-important data, which makes it harder to find and use. This can lead to slower and more inefficient decision-making time frames.
> - The data you need isn’t always easily accessible. 
> - Current technology tools and solutions still struggle to provide measurable and reportable data. This can lead to unfair algorithmic bias. 
> - There are gaps in many big data business solutions.

> Benefits of Big data:
> - When large amounts of data can be stored and analyzed, it can help companies identify more efficient ways of doing business and save a lot of time and money.
> - Big data helps organizations spot the trends of customer buying patterns and satisfaction levels, which can help them create new products and solutions that will make customers happy.
> - By analyzing big data, businesses get a much better understanding of current market conditions, which can help them stay ahead of the competition.
> - Big data helps companies keep track of their online presence—especially feedback, both good and bad, from customers. This gives them the information they need to improve and protect their brand.
> - **volume** : The amount of data.
> - **Variety** : The different kinds of data.
> - **Velocity** : How fast the data can be processed.
> - **Veracity** : The quality and reliability of the data.

## Spreadsheets and the data life cycle

> **Plan**: formatting your cells, the headings you choose to highlight, the color scheme, and the way you order your data points. 

> **Capture**: Capture data by the source by connecting spreadsheets to other data sources, such as an online survey application or a database. This data will automatically be updated in the spreadsheet. That way, the information is always as current and accurate as possible.

> **Manage**: storing, organizing, filtering, and updating information. Spreadsheets also let you decide who can access the data, how the information is shared, and how to keep your data safe and secure. 

> **Analyze**:  formulas to aggregate data or create reports, and pivot tables for clear, easy-to-understand visuals. 

> **Archive**: store historical data 

> **Destroy**: Destroy your spreadsheet when you are certain that you will never need it again, if you have better backup copies, or for legal or security reasons. Keep in mind, lots of businesses are required to follow certain rules or have measures in place to make sure data is destroyed properly.	

## Scope of work (SOW) and structured thinking

> Not to be confused with *statement of work* also *SOW*
>
> A **statement of work** is a document that clearly identifies the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide to an organization. It includes objectives, guidelines, deliverables, schedule, and costs. 
>
>A **scope of work** is project-based and sets the expectations and boundaries of a project. A scope of work may be included in a statement of work to help define project outcomes. 
>
> **structured thinking** is the process of recognizing the current situation, organizing information, and identifing opportunities. 

> **Scope of work**

> - Deliverables : are items or tasks you will complete before you can finish the project. What work is being done, and what things are being created as a result of this project? When the project is complete, what are you expected to deliver to the stakeholders? Be specific here. Will you collect data for this project? How much, or for how long?. Avoid vague statements. For example, “fixing traffic problems” doesn’t specify the scope. This could mean anything from filling in a few potholes to building a new overpass. Be specific! Use numbers and aim for hard, measurable goals and objectives. For example: “Identify top 10 issues with traffic patterns within the city limits, and identify the top 3 solutions that are most cost-effective for reducing traffic congestion.”
>
> - Milestones : are significant tasks you will confirm along your timeline to help everyone know the project is on track.his is closely related to your timeline. What are the major milestones for progress in your project? How do you know when a given part of the project is considered complete? Milestones can be identified by you, by stakeholders, or by other team members such as the Project Manager. Smaller examples might include incremental steps in a larger project like “Collect and process 50% of required data (100 survey responses)”, but may also be larger examples like ”complete initial data analysis report” or “deliver completed dashboard visualizations and analysis reports to stakeholders”. 
>
> - Timeline : include due dates for when deliverables, milestones, and/or reports are due. Your timeline will be closely tied to the milestones you create for your project. The timeline is a way of mapping expectations for how long each step of the process should take. The timeline should be specific enough to help all involved decide if a project is on schedule. When will the deliverables be completed? How long do you expect the project will take to complete? If all goes as planned, how long do you expect each component of the project will take? When can we expect to reach each milestone?
>
> - Reports : notify everyone as you finalize deliverables and meet milestones. Good SOWs also set boundaries for how and when you’ll give status updates to stakeholders. How will you communicate progress with stakeholders and sponsors, and how often? Will progress be reported weekly? Monthly? When milestones are completed? What information will status reports contain?

> SOWs should also contain information specific to what is and isn’t considered part of the project. The scope of your project is everything that you are expected to complete or accomplish, defined to a level of detail that doesn’t leave any ambiguity or confusion about whether a given task or item is part of the project or not. 

## The Importance of Context

*Context can turn raw data into meaningful information*. It is very important for data analysts to contextualize their data. This means giving the data perspective by defining it. To do this, you need to identify:

- Who: The person or organization that created, collected, and/or funded the data collection

- What: The things in the world that data could have an impact on

- Where: The origin of the data

- When: The time when the data was created or collected

- Why: The motivation behind the creation or collection

- How: The method used to create or collect it

## How to communicate your analysis and recommendations

Be sure to answer these four important questions related to your audience:

 - Who is your audience? 

 - What do they already know? 

 - What do they need to know? 

 - How can you best communicate what they need to know?

## Data Modeling
Data modeling is the process of creating diagrams that visually represent how data is organized and structured.  These visual representations are called data models.
*Levels of data modeling*
Each level of data modeling has a different level of detail. 
*Conceptual data modeling* gives a high-level view of the data structure, such as how data interacts across an organization. For example, a conceptual data model may be used to define the business requirements for a new database. A conceptual data model doesn't contain technical details. 

*Logical data modeling* focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities. For example, a logical data model defines how individual records are uniquely identified in a database. But it doesn't spell out actual names of database tables. That's the job of a physical data model.

*Physical data modeling* depicts how a database operates. A physical data model defines all entities and attributes used; for example, it includes table names, column names, and data types for the database.

*Data-modeling techniques*
There are a lot of approaches when it comes to developing data models, but two common methods are the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram. ERDs are a visual way to understand the relationship between entities in the data model. UML diagrams are very detailed diagrams that describe the structure of a system by showing the system's entities, attributes, operations, and their relationships.

## Data Types, Fileds and values

### Boolean - AND, OR, NOT.

Why use Boolean operators?

- To focus a search, particularly when your topic contains multiple search terms.
- To connect various pieces of information to find exactly what you're looking for.
Example:
second creation (title) AND wilmut and campbell (author) AND 2000 (year)

*Using AND*
Use AND in a search to:

- narrow your results
- tell the database that ALL search terms must be present in the resulting records

Be aware:  In many, but not all, databases, the AND is implied. 

For example, Google automatically puts an AND in between your search terms.
Though all your search terms are included in the results, they may not be connected together in the way you want.
For example, this search:  college students test anxiety  is translated to:  college AND students AND test AND anxiety. The words may appear individually throughout the resulting records.
You can search using phrases to make your results more specific.
For example:  "college students" AND "test anxiety". This way, the phrases show up in the results as you expect them to be.

*Using OR*
Use OR in a search to:

- connect two or more similar concepts (synonyms)
- broaden your results, telling the database that ANY of your search terms can be present in the resulting records
example: cloning OR genetics OR reproduction

*Using NOT*
Use NOT in a search to:

- exclude words from your search
- narrow your search, telling the database to ignore concepts that may be implied by your search terms
example:  cloning NOT sheep

*Search order*
Databases follow commands you type in and return results based on those commands. Be aware of the logical order in which words are connected when using Boolean operators: 

- Databases usually recognize AND as the primary operator, and will connect concepts with AND together first.
- If you use a combination of AND and OR operators in a search, enclose the words to be "ORed" together in parentheses.
 

Examples:

- ethics AND (cloning OR reproductive techniques)
- (ethic* OR moral*) AND (bioengineering OR cloning)

### Wide and long data

*Long data* is data where *each row contains a single data point* for a particular item. In the long data example below, individual stock prices (data points) have been collected for Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOGL) (particular items) on the given dates.
<img src="/Data_Analysis/img/long_data.png"  width="600">

*Wide data* is data where *each row contains multiple data points* for the particular items identified in the columns. 

<img src="/Data_Analysis/img/wide_data.png"  width="600">

| Wide data is preferred when                                        | Long data is preferred when                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creating tables and charts with a few variables about each subject | Storing a lot of variables about each subject. For example, 60 years worth of interest rates for each bank |
| Comparing straightforward line graphs                              | Performing advanced statistical analysis or graphing                                                       |
---
## Open Data
Openness refers to free access, usage, and sharing of data. But for data to be considered open, it has to:
- Be available and accessible to the public as a complete dataset
- Be provided under terms that allow it to be reused and redistributed
- Allow universal participation so that anyone can use, reuse, and redistribute the data
Data can only be considered open when it meets all three of these standards.
---

## Databases
### Relational Databases and keys
A *relational database* is a database that contains a series of tables that can be connected to show relationships. 

*Normalization* is a process of organizing data in a relational database. For example, creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables. It is applied to **eliminate data redundancy**, **increase data integrity**, and **reduce complexity** in a database.

A *primary key* is an identifier that references a column in which each value is unique. In other words, it's a column of a table that is used to uniquely identify each record within that table. The value assigned to the primary key in a particular row must be unique within the entire table. For example, if customer_id is the primary key for the customer table, no two customers will ever have the same customer_id. **It cannot contain null or blank values.**

A *foreign key* is a field within a table that is a primary key in another table. A table can have only one primary key, but it can have multiple foreign keys. 

These keys(Both primary and foreign) are what create the relationships between tables in a relational database, which helps organize and connect data across multiple tables in the database. 

<img src="/Data_Analysis/img/database_keys.png"  width="900">

- A primary key may also be constructed using multiple columns of a table. This type of primary key is called a *composite key*.
    - If customer_id and location_id are two columns of a composite key for a customer table, the values assigned to those fields in any given row must be unique within the entire table.
- Some tables don't require a primary key. For example, a revenue table can have multiple foreign keys and not have a primary key.

### Metadata repository
Using a *metadata repository*, a data analyst can find it easier to bring together multiple sources of data, confirm how or when data was collected, and verify that data from an outside source is being used appropriately. 

*Descriptive metadata* – the descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.Descriptive metadata describes a piece of data or can be used to identify it at any time.

*Structural metadata* – Structural metadata indicates exactly how many collections data lives in. It provides information about how a piece of data is organized and whether it’s part of one, or more than one, data collection. 

*Administrative metadata* – the information to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created. Administrative metadata indicates the technical source and details for a digital asset.

*Reference metadata* – the information about the contents and quality of statistical data.

*Statistical metadata* also called *process data*, may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.

*Legal metadata* – provides information about the creator, copyright holder, and public licensing, if provided.

| Gather the data on a small scale to perform a preliminary analysis and then request additional time to complete the analysis after you have collected more data. | If you are surveying employees about what they think about a new performance and bonus plan, use a sample for a preliminary analysis. Then, ask for another 3 weeks to collect the data from all employees. |
| If there isn’t time to collect data, perform the analysis using proxy data from other datasets.  _This is the most common workaround._                           | If you are analyzing peak travel times for commuters but don’t have the data for a particular city, use the data from another city with a similar size and demographic.                                     |

| If you can’t correct data errors yourself, you can ignore the wrong data and go ahead with the analysis if your sample size is still large enough and ignoring the data won’t cause systematic bias. | If your dataset was translated from a different language and some of the translations don’t make sense, ignore the data with bad translation and go ahead with the analysis of the other data.    |

## Calculating sample size 

| Terminology              | Definitions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Population               | The entire group that you are interested in for your study. For example, if you are surveying people in your company, the population would be all the employees in your company.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Sample                   | A subset of your population. Just like a food sample, it is called a sample because it is only a taste. So if your company is too large to survey every individual, you can survey a representative sample of your population.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Margin of error          | Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sample’s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. This difference is called the margin of error. The smaller the margin of error, the closer the results of the sample are to what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. |
| Confidence level         | How confident you are in the survey results. For example, a 95% confidence level means that if you were to run the same survey 100 times, you would get similar results 95 of those 100 times. Confidence level is targeted before you start your study because it will affect how big your margin of error is at the end of your study.                                             |
| Confidence interval      | The range of possible values that the population’s result would be at the confidence level of the study. This range is the sample result +/- the margin of error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Statistical significance | The determination of whether your result could be due to random chance or not. The greater the significance, the less due to chance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

*Things to remember when determining the size of your sample*
When figuring out a sample size, here are things to keep in mind:

- Don’t use a sample size less than 30. It has been statistically proven that 30 is the smallest sample size where an average result of a sample starts to represent the average result of a population.
- The confidence level most commonly used is 95%, but 90% can work in some cases. 

Increase the sample size to meet specific needs of your project:
- For a higher confidence level, use a larger sample size
- To decrease the margin of error, use a larger sample size
- For greater statistical significance, use a larger sample size

| Data exploration                              | Partially            | Sometimes the best way to understand data is to see it.

*QUESTION:*
I have a rule which i need to auto fill for 4,000 rows.
The rule for the first row is =VLOOKUP(H1,Sheet1!A1:C69,2,FALSE)
I would like the second row to be =VLOOKUP(H2,Sheet1!A1:C69,2,FALSE)
And the third row to be =VLOOKUP(H3,Sheet1!A1:C69,2,FALSE)
etc.
You can see that only the H1,H2,H3 corresponds to the row and I need the A1:C69 to stay the same for each cell.
When I do the autofill function in excel it increments A1:C69 by 1 on each row, which is not what I need.
so row two is effectively: =VLOOKUP(H2,Sheet1!A2:C70,2,FALSE)
How can I do it so it just increments the first part of the formula?

*SOLUTION:*
Make the lookup array absolute by using dollar signs:

``=VLOOKUP(H1,Sheet1!$A$1:$C$69,2,FALSE)``

## Different data perspectives for data cleaning
### Sorting & Filtering

*Sorting*
    Arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.
*Filtering*   
    Showing only the data that meet a specific criteria while hiding the rest.

### Pivot Tables
  Data summarisation tool that is used in data processing.
    [Create a pivot table from microsoft docs](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576)

### VLOOKUP
    A function that searches for a certain value in a column to return a corresponding piece of information.
    It takes a value from one cell and searches for a match in another place.
*Syntax:*
    =VLOOKUP(data to look up, 'where to look' !Range, column, false).
*Example:*
    ==VLOOKUP($A2, 'Sheet 2' !A1:B31, 2, false)

> **note:**
> The $ sign makes sure the corresponding part of the reference remains unchanged or locked
    - you can lock just a column, $A2
    - Just the row, A$2
    - Or both at the same time $A$2
> Last term 'false' denotes that we want an EXACT match.

### Plotting
    Plotting is very useful when trying to identify any skewed data or outliers.

### Data Mapping
    Data mapping is the process of matching fields from one database to another.
    This is very important to the success of data migration, data integration, and lots of other data management activities.
        - The first step to data mapping is identifying what data needs to be moved. 
        - next step, transforming the data into a consistent format. `concatenate` is a function that joins together two or more text strings, 
        - We also need to define the desired format for the data once it reaches its destination. 
        - Next comes mapping the data. Depending on the schema and number of primary and foreign keys in a data source, data mapping can be simple or very complex.
            - A schema is a way of describing how something is organized.
            - A primary key references a column in which each value is unique.
            - A foreign key is a field within a table that is a primary key in another table.
            - We'll go into the testing phase of data mapping. For this, you inspect a sample piece of data to confirm that it's clean and properly formatted.

## SQL queries
```sql
    SELECT `column1, column2`
    FROM `table1, table2` 
    WHERE `column2='value'`;
```
```sql
    INSERT INTO `table_name`
    (`list of columns we are adding this data to`)
   VALUES
    (`what values we are putting in`)
```
```sql
    UPDATE **table_name**
    SET `col we are trying to change` = 'New value'
    WHERE `condition = 'value'`
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] `table_name`(
   `column_1_definition,`
   `column_2_definition,`
   ...
    );
```
```sql
    DROP [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF EXISTS] table_name [, table_name] [RESTRICT | CASCADE];
    - The DROP TABLE statement deletes a table and its rows permanently.
    - The [TEMPORARY] option ensures you remove temporary tables only.
    - The [IF EXISTS] option drops a table only if it exists.
    - The [RESTRICT]. It ensures that a parent row is not deleted if a child row is referencing a value in said parent row.
    - The [CASCADE] option ensures that when you delete a row, all rows in related tables that reference that row are deleted as well. 
```
```sql
 SELECT 
  country
    FROM `table`
  WHERE
    LENGTH(`column_name`) > 2
```
```sql
    SUBSTR(string, start, length)
    *Example*
    SELECT 
    customer_id
    FROM `table`
    WHERE
    SUBSTR(country,1,2) = 'IN'
```

```sql
TRIM 
```
CAST() Can be used to convert anything from one data type to another.

### CASE-STUDY using SQL queries

[Click the link to the automobile_data file to download it.](/Data_Analysis/automobile_data.csv)

*Step 1: Inspect the fuel_type column*
The first thing you want to do is inspect the data in your table so you can find out if there is any specific cleaning that needs to be done. According to the data’s description, the fuel_type column should only have two unique string values: diesel and gas. To check and make sure that’s true, run the following query: 

```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT fuel_type
FROM
  cars.car_info;
```

*Step 2: Inspect the length column*
Next, you will inspect a column with numerical data. The length column should contain numeric measurements of the cars. So you will check that the minimum and maximum lengths in the dataset align with the data description, which states that the lengths in this column should range from 141.1 to 208.1. Run this query to confirm 
```sql
SELECT
  MIN(length) AS min_length,
  MAX(length) AS max_length
FROM
  cars.car_info;
```
Your results should confirm that 141.1 and 208.1 are the minimum and maximum values respectively in this column. 

*Step 3: Fill in missing data*
Missing values can create errors or skew your results during analysis. You’re going to want to check your data for null or missing values. These values might appear as a blank cell or the word null in BigQuery. 

You can check to see if the num_of_doors column contains null values using this query: 
```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  cars.car_info 
WHERE 
  num_of_doors IS NULL;
```
This will select any rows with missing data for the num_of_doors column and return them in your results table. You should get two results, one Mazda and one Dodge: 

In order to fill in these missing values, you check with the sales manager, who states that all Dodge gas sedans and all Mazda diesel sedans sold had four doors. If you are using the BigQuery free trial, you can use this query to update your table so that all Dodge gas sedans have four doors:
```sql
UPDATE
  cars.car_info
SET
  num_of_doors = "four"
WHERE
  make = "dodge"
  AND fuel_type = "gas"
  AND body_style = "sedan";
```
You should get a message telling you that three rows were modified in this table. To make sure, you can run the previous query again:
```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  cars.car_info 
WHERE 
  num_of_doors IS NULL;
```
Now, you only have one row with a NULL value for num_of_doors. Repeat this process to replace the null value for the Mazda. 

*Step 4: Identify potential errors*
Once you have finished ensuring that there aren’t any missing values in your data, you’ll want to check for other potential errors. You can use SELECT DISTINCT to check what values exist in a column. You can run this query to check the num_of_cylinders column: 
```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT num_of_cylinders
FROM
  cars.car_info;
```
After running this, you notice that there are one too many rows. There are two entries for two cylinders: rows 6 and 7. But the two in row 7 is misspelled. 

To correct the misspelling for all rows, you can run this query if you have the BigQuery free trial: 
```sql
UPDATE
  cars.car_info
SET
  num_of_cylinders = "two"
WHERE
  num_of_cylinders = "tow";
```
You will get a message alerting you that one row was modified after running this statement. To check that it worked, you can run the previous query again: 
```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT num_of_cylinders
FROM
  cars.car_info;
```
Next, you can check the compression_ratio column. According to the data description, the compression_ratio column values should range from 7 to 23. Just like when you checked the length values , you can use MIN and MAX to check if that’s correct: 
```sql
SELECT
  MIN(compression_ratio) AS min_compression_ratio,
  MAX(compression_ratio) AS max_compression_ratio
FROM
  cars.car_info;
```
Notice that this returns a maximum of 70. But you know this is an error because the maximum value in this column should be 23, not 70. So the 70 is most likely a 7.0. Run the above query again without the row with 70 to make sure that the rest of the values fall within the expected range of 7 to 23.
```sql
SELECT
  MIN(compression_ratio) AS min_compression_ratio,
  MAX(compression_ratio) AS max_compression_ratio
FROM
  cars.car_info
WHERE
  compression_ratio <> 70;
```
Now the highest value is 23, which aligns with the data description. So you’ll want to correct the 70 value. You check with the sales manager again, who says that this row was made in error and should be removed. Before you delete anything, you should check to see how many rows contain this erroneous value as a precaution so that you don’t end up deleting 50% of your data. If there are too many (for instance, 20% of your rows have the incorrect 70 value), then you would want to check back in with the sales manager to inquire if these should be deleted or if the 70 should be updated to another value. Use the query below to count how many rows you would be deleting:
```sql
SELECT
   COUNT(*) AS num_of_rows_to_delete
FROM
   cars.car_info
WHERE
   compression_ratio = 70;
```
Turns out there is only one row with the erroneous 70 value. So you can delete that row using this query:  
```sql
DELETE cars.car_info
WHERE compression_ratio = 70;
```
If you are using the BigQuery sandbox, you can replace DELETE with SELECT to see which row would be deleted. 

*Step 5: Ensure consistency*

Finally, you want to check your data for any inconsistencies that might cause errors. These inconsistencies can be tricky to spot — sometimes even something as simple as an extra space can cause a problem.

Check the drive_wheels column for inconsistencies by running a query with a SELECT DISTINCT statement: 
```sql
 SELECT
  DISTINCT drive_wheels
FROM
  cars.car_info;
```
It appears that 4wd appears twice in results. However, because you used a SELECT DISTINCT statement to return unique values, this probably means there’s an extra space in one of the 4wd entries that makes it different from the other 4wd. 
To check if this is the case, you can use a LENGTH statement to determine the length of how long each of these string variables: 
```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT drive_wheels,
  LENGTH(drive_wheels) AS string_length
FROM
  cars.car_info;
```
According to these results, some instances of the 4wd string have four characters instead of the expected three (4wd has 3 characters). In that case, you can use the TRIM function to remove all extra spaces in the drive_wheels column if you are using the BigQuery free trial: 
```sql
UPDATE
  cars.car_info
SET
  drive_wheels = TRIM(drive_wheels)
WHERE TRUE;
```

Then, you run the SELECT DISTINCT statement again to ensure that there are only three distinct values in the drive_wheels column: 
```sql
 SELECT
  DISTINCT drive_wheels
FROM
  cars.car_info;
```
And now there should only be three unique values in this column! Which means your data is clean,  consistent, and ready for analysis!
